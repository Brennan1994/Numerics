    /// <b> Description: </b>
    /// In its most basic form, the Trapezoidal rule approximates the region under the graph of f(x) as a trapezoid and calculating its area as:
    /// <code>
    ///         b
    ///         ∫ f(x) dx ~ T(a, b) = (b - a) * [ f(a) + f(b) ] / 2
    ///         a
    /// </code>
    /// This method can also be seen as averaging the left and right Riemann sums. Moreover, the interval can be subdivided to improve the accuracy of the approximation, with
    /// the trapezoidal rule applied to every sub-interval. Here the integration steps are refined, i.e. the interval is subdivided, until convergence.
