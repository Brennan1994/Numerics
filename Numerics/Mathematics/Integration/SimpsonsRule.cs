    /// <b> Description: </b>
    /// Simpson's rule approximates the integral by splitting the interval and evaluating the function at those split points. The most basic implementation of this is the
    /// following equation for the integral of f(x) over [a, b] with 2 subdivisions:
    /// <code>
    ///         b
    ///         ∫ f(x) dx ~ S(a, b) = (b - a) / 6 * [ f(a) + 4*f(m) + f(b) ]
    ///         a
    /// </code>
    /// where m is the midpoint [ (a+b) / 2 ] between a and b. The more subdivisions there are, i.e. the more refined the steps are, the more accurate the approximation becomes.
