    /// This class contains a shared function for finding the solution to the equation f(x)=0 using the bisection method.
    /// Bisection method is a variation of the incremental search method in which the interval is always divided in half.  
    /// If a function changes sign over an interval, the function value at the midpoint is evaluated. The location 
    /// of the root is then determined as lying within the interval for the next iteration.
