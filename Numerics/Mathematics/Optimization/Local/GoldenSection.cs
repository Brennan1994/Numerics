    /// This class contains a shared function for finding the minimum or maximum of a function using the Golden-Section method.
    /// This method operates by successively narrowing the range of values on the specified interval. When searching for a
    /// minimum, the central point is always less than or equal to the outer points, assuring that a minimum is contained 
    /// between the outer points.
